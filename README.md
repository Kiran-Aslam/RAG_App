# RAG_App

A powerful **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** application that lets you upload any PDF and ask questions about its content. This project combines **vector similarity search (FAISS)** with **LLaMA-3** (via Groq API) to generate smart, context-aware answers from the document.

 Split and embed content using SentenceTransformer  
 Search relevant chunks with FAISS vector similarity  
 Generate responses using LLaMA-3 via Groq API  
 Simple and clean **Gradio UI**  
 Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces

##  How It Works

1.  **Upload PDF** — Parses and extracts text using `PyPDF2`  
2.  **Chunking** — Splits text into overlapping sections  
3.  **Embeddings** — Uses `MiniLM-L6-v2` from `sentence-transformers`  
4.  **Indexing** — Stores embeddings in a FAISS index  
5.  **Ask a Question** — Your question is converted to an embedding  
6.  **Retrieval + Generation** — Top chunks retrieved & passed to Groq LLaMA-3 for response
